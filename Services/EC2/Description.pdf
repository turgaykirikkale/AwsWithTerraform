EC2=>

An EC2 instance is a virtual server running on Amazon Web Services (AWS).
 Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) allows users to create virtual servers (instances) with various configurations based on their needs.
  These instances function similarly to a physical server but are hosted on AWSâ€™s cloud infrastructure.

Key features of EC2 instances include:

Various Operating Systems: They can run different operating systems, such as Windows or Linux.
Scalability: Resources like CPU, memory, and storage can be increased or decreased as needed.
Different Types: There are various instance types tailored to different needs, such as general-purpose, compute-optimized, 
or memory-optimized instances.
Flexibility: You can create, stop, start, or terminate an instance whenever needed.
Security: EC2 instances are protected through security groups and network access control lists (ACLs).


AMI =>

AWS AMI (Amazon Machine Image) is a template used to create virtual servers (EC2 instances) on Amazon Web Services (AWS).
An AMI includes an operating system, application software, and configurations. 
With an AMI, you can quickly launch EC2 instances with a specific setup. AMIs generally contain the following components:

Operating System: Operating systems such as Windows or Linux.
Applications and Software: Pre-installed applications and software.
Configuration Settings: Custom configurations like network and security settings.
